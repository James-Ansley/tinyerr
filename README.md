## Example

`main.py`:

```python
def foo(x, y):
    return bar(x, y)


def bar(x, y):
    return x + y


result = foo(5, "Hello")
print(result)
```

Running `tinyerr main.py` produces:

```text
File "main.py", line 9, in <module>

    result = foo(5, "Hello")
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

File "main.py", line 2, in foo

    return bar(x, y)
           ^^^^^^^^^

File "main.py", line 6, in bar

    return x + y
           ~~^~~

TypeError: cannot do `<int> + <str>`
```

By default, the traceback limit is set to 0 (the entire stack). This can be
configured with the `-tb` or `--traceback` command line option.
e.g. `tinyerr -tb 1 main.py` will yield:

```text
File "main.py", line 6, in bar

    return x + y
           ~~^~~

TypeError: cannot do `<int> + <str>`
```
