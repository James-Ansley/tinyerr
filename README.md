TinyErr (pronounced tinier) provides tiny errors that get straight to the point.

## Install

```
pip install tinyerr
```

> While TinyErr is in alpha, it may be best to install directly from GitHub for
> the latest changes:

> ```

## Example

`main.py`:

```python
def foo(x, y):
    return bar(x, y)


def bar(x, y):
    return x + y


result = foo(5, "Hello")
print(result)
```

Running `tinyerr main.py` produces:

```text
File "main.py", line 6, in bar

    return x + y
           ~~^~~

TypeError: cannot do `<int> + <str>`
```

If you _really_ need to see the traceback, run `tinyerr trace` which will show
the full traceback from TinyErr's _last encountered exception_:

```text
File "main.py", line 9, in <module>

    result = foo(5, "Hello")
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

File "main.py", line 2, in foo

    return bar(x, y)
           ^^^^^^^^^

File "main.py", line 6, in bar

    return x + y
           ~~^~~

TypeError: cannot do `<int> + <str>`
```
